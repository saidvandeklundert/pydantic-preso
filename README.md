# Talk about Pydantic


Talk about Pydantic, and why I think it is the greatest Python package ever!


The talk is one where I spend all the time in the IDE and walk people through the following scenarios:
- 00: base example on creating an instance of a Pydantic class
- 01: high level comparison between pydantic and dataclass
- 02: emphasize nested models are created 'automagically'
- 03: embedding an Enum to restrict choices
- 04: using Enum values instead of the Enum
- 05: validation of data
- 06: pre and post validation of data
- 07: validate and compare all fields of a model, pre and post
- 08: dynamic model creation
- 09: coercion of data and strict mode
- 10: aliasing when serializing
- 11: emphasizing it can be used like other classes
